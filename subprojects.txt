  All of the Shared project modules are for storing images and XML files which prototype the data that goes into a game
project. The shared modules:

  - brm-editor-defaults
    - beyondrm.editor.defaults
      - currently only contains one XML file for persisting the editor's states across sessions.

  - brm-project-globals  - both paths have packages for facesets, fontsets, and tilesets.
    - beyondrm.abstract.*
      - .
    - beyondrm.globals.images.*

  - brm-project-prototype
    - beyondrm.project
      - project definition, credits.
    - beyondrm.project.database.*
      - project database: attributes/elements, animations, characters, classes, conditions/states, monsters, troops,...
    - beyondrm.project.mapmaker.*
      - project mapping: map-making attributes, the maps list, map data/layers, map events/scripts
    - beyondrm.project.system.*
      - project system data: fontsets, tilesets, variables, etc. Things that apply to the Engine as static resources...
    - .
      - .

  - brm-project-samples
    - beyondrm.project.samples.*
      - project samples and templates for minimalist, typical, and extended projects.

  - brm-project-spritegen
    - beyondrm.project.tooldata.spritery.*
      - editor sprite resources for creating custom sprites and faces for characters.

  - openrpgmaker
    - archival module of the competition's (namely, Open RPG Maker) XML files. This should only exist for the reason of
      holding the extraneous XML format files while I am comparing/creating my own implementation.
