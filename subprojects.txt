The subprojects of this repository may be as many as necessary; but they will generally be for one of the following use
cases:
- editor-related
  - editor meta-data files
  - editor project-related metadata files: for describing the properties of the project; this meta-data will not end up
    being included in the built data.
- engine-related
  -
- platform-related
  -
- miscellaneous
  -



- archival storage of the competition's (namely, Open RPG Maker) XML format files, in a working data tree. This will be
  for no other reason to hold the extraneous XML format files while I am comparing/creating my own implementation.
- a project for storing the project-baseline files. This is for the primary project data that is part of the project's
  game database.
- a project for storing the project-supplement files, such as graphics and media files.
- a project for storing the miscellaneous support files, such as for things the editor may track that do not
  go into the built game-data.
- a project for storing editor-utilities data, such as XML files and graphics for a sprite and animation editor.
