<!--
This contains tagged XML data for controlling just what editing-session properties are retained between sessions. These
tags control whether the editor is fullscreen, the various user-interface attributes, and the last-used project (and if
we should re-open the last project) We are not handling having multiple projects open (not yet, anyway), so this should
only handle the last opened project.

This base path for this file is meant as the root "BeyondRM" directory within the user's "My Documents" path. It should
contain subdirectories for the defaults and the projects; each of those contains their own hierarchies.
