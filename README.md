# The BRM_SharedMedia Project.
This is for the shared media which will go into production of the BeyondRM editor, engine, and platform components. It can include many kinds of shared assets: audio files, graphical images, and sample data -- all useful for editing and distributing a classic-console-rpg-styled game.

The intention of this repository is to begin collecting shared assets, such as background musics, sound effects, tilesets, iconsets, facesets, battler graphics, ... anything which may be useful to the production of a simple `RPG Maker`-styled, classic role-playing game system. The directory hierarchy may be generally similar to the aforementioned RPG Maker, with graphical assets also being similar, with a few minor changes.

The format of some of these art assets (namely, the tilesets and such) must necessarily be slightly different from the "other" RPG Maker editor program(s). This is not merely to break from what is familiar to others; but in changing the format of autotile graphics, we can perhaps allow greater possibilities for auto-tiling and mapping. (One goal is to go beyond the 32x32-pixel tile-size, to include 64x64-pixel tilesets.)

## Contribution and Usage Permissions.
Game assets may be freely contributed to this repository, without requiring compensation, under the condition that it is agreed that assets will be available for anyone to also use them, under the terms of the `GNU GPL v3` license.

Under additional circumstances, some art and media may be contributed including additional permissions or restrictions from the author. One such restriction that seems a popular request is that the asset is not used in games which are pornographic; and we who supply the game assets would implore the individual game-maker to agree to those terms, or exclude them from their project.
